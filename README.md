ADC
 Only Volatge , current ADC is working at a particular time 
 simultaneously connecting the Volatge and Current will misled the calculation 
 Voltage unit is mV

DAC
 Volatge section is working properly
 Current Section fails to provide the 4-20mA output but voltage from the DAC is given to V to I Convertor

DO
